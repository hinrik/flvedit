      # Base is the base class for all Processors.
      # Processors are used to process FLV files.
      # A FLV file can be seen as an enumeration of chunks, the first one being a Header and the following ones
      # a series of Tags with different types of bodies: Audio, Video or Event.
      # A Processor acts as an IO operation on such enumerations.
      # They therefore take an enumeration of chunks as input and their output is similarly an enumeration of chunks.
      # They can thus be chained together at will.
      #
      # For example:
      #   FLV::File.open("x.flv") do |f|
      #     Debug.new(Cut.new(f, :cut => "1m-")).first(10)
      #   end
      #   # ==> reads the file, skips the first minute, prints and returns the first 10 chunks
      #
      # Processors acts as Enumerable, but #each, in that context, is an enumeration of chunks
      # for one single file. Some processors act as more than one such enumeration (Reader, Split)
      # To go through all, call #each_source or #process_all
      #
